class SourceResolver(object):
    '''Provides a way of resolving the set of sources for a given system.

    There are three levels of caching involved in resolving the sources to
    build.

    The canonical repo for each source is specified in the build-command
    (for strata and systems) or in the stratum morphology (for chunks). It will
    be either a normal URL, or a keyed URL using a repo-alias like
    'baserock:baserock/definitions'.

    The 'remote repo cache' is a Baserock Trove system. It functions as a
    normal Git server, but in addition it runs a service on port 8080 called
    'morph-cache-server' which can resolve refs, list their contents and read
    specific files from the repos it holds. This allows the SourceResolver to
    work out how to build something without cloning the whole repo. (If a local
    build of that source ends up being necessary then it will get cloned into
    the local cache later on).

    The second layer of caching is the local repository cache, which mirrors
    entire repositories in $cachedir/gits. If a repo is not in the remote repo
    cache then it must be present in the local repo cache.

    The third layer of caching is a simple commit SHA1 -> tree SHA mapping. It
    turns out that even if all repos are available locally, running
    'git rev-parse' on hundreds of repos requires a lot of IO and can take
    several minutes. Likewise, on a slow network connection it is time
    consuming to keep querying the remote repo cache. This third layer of
    caching works around both of those issues.

    The need for 3 levels of caching highlights design inconsistencies in
    Baserock, but for now it is worth the effort to maintain this code to save
    users from waiting 7 minutes each time that they want to build. The level 3
    cache is fairly simple because commits are immutable, so there is no danger
    of this cache being stale as long as it is indexed by commit SHA1. Due to
    the policy in Baserock of always using a commit SHA1 (rather than a named
    ref) in the system definitions, it makes repeated builds of a system very
    fast as no resolution needs to be done at all.

    Given a system morphology, this function will traverse the tree of stratum
