    There are two levels of caching involved in resolving the sources to build.

    The canonical source for each source is specified in the build-command
    (for strata and systems) or in the stratum morphology (for chunks). It will
    be either a normal URL, or a keyed URL using a repo-alias like
    'baserock:baserock/definitions'.

    The 'remote repo cache' is a Baserock Trove system. It functions as a
    normal Git server, but in addition it runs a service on port 8080 called
    'morph-cache-server' which can resolve refs, list their contents and read
    specific files from the repos it holds. This allows the SourceResolver to
    work out how to build something without cloning the whole repo. (If a local
    build of that source ends up being necessary then it will get cloned into
    the local cache later on).

    The second layer of caching is the local repository cache, which mirrors
    entire repositories in $cachedir/gits. If a repo is not in the remote repo
    cache then it must be present in the local repo cache.
