description:
  This is a JSON-Schema description of a 'cluster' .morph file, which is part
  of the Baserock definitions YAML representation format.

  This JSON-Schema file is valid for VERSION 7 of the Baserock definitions
  YAML serialisation format.

  The Baserock definitions format is the recommended way of representing
  Baserock definitions on disk. The actual data model is described separately.
  See https://wiki.baserock.org/definitions for more information.

  This schema is represented as YAML, so that it can be edited more easily.
  You may need to convert to JSON if using a JSON-Schema tool that expects
  its input to be an actual string containing data serialised as JSON.
