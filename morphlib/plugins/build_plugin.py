        This command launches a distributed build, to use this command
        you must first set up a distbuild cluster.

        Artifacts produced during the build will be stored on your trove.

        Once the build completes you can use morph deploy to the deploy
        your system, the system artifact will be copied from your trove
        and cached locally.

        Log information can be found in the current working directory, in
        directories called build-xx.

        If you do not have a persistent connection to the server on which
        the distbuild runs, consider using `morph distbuild-start` instead.

        This builds a system image, and any of its components that
        need building.  The system name is the basename of the system
        morphology, in the root repository of the current system branch,
        without the `.morph` suffix in the filename.

        The location of the resulting system image artifact is printed
        at the end of the build output.

        If the 'local-changes' setting is set to 'include', you do not need
        to commit your changes before building. Morph does that for you, in a
        temporary branch for each build. Note that any system produced this way
        will not be reproducible later on as the branch it is built from will
        have been deleted. Also note that Morph does not add untracked files to
        the temporary branch, only uncommitted changes to files git already
        knows about. You need to `git add` and commit each new file yourself.
