Artifact splitting tests
========================

Parsing and validation
----------------------

To verify that the products fields are parsed correctly, we have a
scenario that uses all of them, not relying on the default rules.

    SCENARIO building a system with morphologies that have splitting rules
    GIVEN a git server

To test that all the fields are recognised, we set the new fields to
their default values.

    AND chunk test-chunk includes the default splitting rules
    AND stratum strata/core.morph includes the default splitting rules
    AND system systems/test-system.morph includes the default splitting rules

The default rules produce a system that is identical to not providing
them, and since this test is about validation, we don't care about the
result, so much as it succeeding to build something.

    WHEN the user clones definitions
    THEN morph build the system systems/test-system.morph of the branch master
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

Smaller systems
---------------

An example use-case for splitting is to only include the runtime
strata for a target system, rather than including all the development
information, such as the documentation, C library headers and C static
libraries.

    SCENARIO building a system only using runtime strata
    GIVEN a git server

The only change we need to make is to add a field to the system morphology
to select which artifact to use in the system.

    AND system systems/test-system.morph uses core-runtime from core

The best way to test that only using some stratum artifacts works is
to check which files the output has, so we deploy a tarball and inspect
its contents.

    GIVEN a cluster called test-cluster.morph in branch master
    AND a system in cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master called test-system
    AND system test-system in cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master builds systems/test-system.morph
    AND system test-system in cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master has deployment type: tar
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user builds the system systems/test-system.morph in branch master
    AND the user attempts to deploy the cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master with options test-system.location="$DATADIR/test.tar"

The -runtime artifacts include executables and shared libraries.

    THEN morph succeeded
    AND tarball test.tar contains bin/test
    AND tarball test.tar contains lib/libtest.so

The -devel artifacts include static libraries and documentation, so if
we've successfully excluded it, we won't have those files.

    AND tarball test.tar doesn't contain lib/libtest.a
    AND tarball test.tar doesn't contain man/man3/test.3.gz
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

As a consequence of how dependencies are generated, if we select strata
to go into our system, such that there are chunk artifacts that are not
needed, then they don't get built.

    SCENARIO building a system that has unused chunks
    GIVEN a git server

This GIVEN has a chunk in the stratum that never successfully builds,
so we know that if the system successfully builds, then we only built
chunks that were needed.

    AND stratum strata/core.morph has chunks that aren't used in core-minimal
    AND system systems/test-system.morph uses core-minimal from core
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    THEN morph build the system systems/test-system.morph of the branch master
    FINALLY the git server is shut down
