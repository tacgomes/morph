Morph Building Tests
======================

    SCENARIO attempting to build a system morphology which has never been committed
    GIVEN a git server
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user creates an uncommitted system morphology called systems/base-system.morph for our architecture in branch master
    AND the user attempts to build the system systems/base-system.morph in branch master
    THEN morph succeeded
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

    SCENARIO build system with relative path
    GIVEN a git server
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user creates an uncommitted system morphology called systems/base-system.morph for our architecture in branch master
    AND from the directory definitions/systems the user attempts to morph build the system base-system.morph
    THEN morph succeeded
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

    SCENARIO build system with relative path (second variant)
    GIVEN a git server
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user creates an uncommitted system morphology called systems/base-system.morph for our architecture in branch master
    AND from the directory definitions/systems the user attempts to morph build the system ../systems/base-system.morph
    THEN morph succeeded
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

    SCENARIO build system with absolute path
    GIVEN a git server
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user creates an uncommitted system morphology called systems/base-system.morph for our architecture in branch master
    AND from the directory definitions/systems the user attempts to morph build the system using the absolute path to base-system.morph
    THEN morph succeeded
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

System integrations
-------------------

`system-integration` is a field in chunk morphologies that allows you to
have some scripts run at system artifact construction time, because some
things need to be done after every chunk is built, such as `ldconfig`,
so every library path in `/etc/ld.so.conf` can be found, and it can look
up libraries more quickly.

    SCENARIO using system integrations
    GIVEN a git server
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user attempts to build the system systems/test-system.morph in branch master
    THEN morph succeeded

In our example, we have a system integration that creates /etc/passwd,
so when we deploy the system, we can check whether it exists.

    GIVEN a cluster called clusters/test-cluster.morph in branch master
    AND a system in cluster clusters/test-cluster.morph in branch master called test-system
    AND system test-system in cluster clusters/test-cluster.morph in branch master builds systems/test-system.morph
    AND system test-system in cluster clusters/test-cluster.morph in branch master has deployment type: tar
    WHEN the user attempts to deploy the cluster clusters/test-cluster.morph in branch master with options test-system.location="$DATADIR/test.tar"
    THEN morph succeeded
    AND tarball test.tar contains etc/passwd
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

Distbuilding
------------

    SCENARIO distbuilding
    ASSUMING the morph-cache-server can be run
    GIVEN a git server
    AND a communal cache server
    AND a distbuild worker
    AND a distbuild controller

Distbuilding works much the same way as regular building.

    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user creates an uncommitted system morphology called systems/base-system.morph for our architecture in branch master
    THEN morph distbuild the system systems/base-system.morph of the branch master

Distbuilt systems can be deployed locally, since the building process
lets you download the artifacts for local use.

Note: Currently broken. It's currently complaining about not having
repos cached locally.

>   GIVEN a cluster called test-cluster.morph in branch master
>   AND a system in cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master called test-system
>   AND system test-system in cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master builds systems/base-system.morph
>   AND system test-system in cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master has deployment type: sysroot
>   AND system test-system in cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master has deployment location: test-system
>   WHEN the user attempts to deploy the cluster test-cluster.morph in branch master
>   THEN morph succeeded
>   AND file workspace/master/test/morphs/test-system exists

    FINALLY the distbuild controller is terminated
    AND the distbuild worker is terminated
    AND the communal cache server is terminated
    AND the git server is shut down

Empty strata don't build
------------------------

    SCENARIO empty-strata
    GIVEN a git server
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user attempts to build the system systems/empty-stratum-system.morph in branch empty-stratum
    THEN morph failed
    FINALLY the git server is shut down

Partial building
----------------

    SCENARIO partial building
    GIVEN a git server
    WHEN the user clones definitions
    AND the user attempts to build build-essential from the system systems/test-system.morph in branch master
    THEN morph succeeded
    FINALLY the git server is shut down
